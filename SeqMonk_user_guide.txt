1. Annotation Sets (input)
- core genome (mm10/hg19)
- HindIII (digested file from HiCUP digester)

2. Bam file (input)
- output of HiCUP

3. Processing
Data -> Define probes -> feature probe generator -> features to design around -> HindIII -> create probes -> fixed value quantitation

Filtering -> filter by position -> chr2 (or any chromosome of interest) -> Run filter

Trend Plot -> probe

Data -> Define probes -> merge consecutive probes generator -> number of probes to merge -> 100 -> step size -> 50

Read count quantitation -> quantitate

Filtering -> probe length filter -> 600,000

Filtering -> statistical test -> boxwhisker -> run filter

Filtering -> combine lists -> probe length BUT NOT outliers

x/y probes left

Data -> quantitate existing probes -> subtract median chr value

red - trans
blue - cis

Filtering -> statistical test -> boxwhisker -> run filter

Filtering -> combine lists -> sensible BUT NOT above (sensible cis/trans interactions)

z/y probes left

4. Heatmap
Create heat map & save annotation. The saved file has significant interactions.

# Alternatively, after getting HiCUP output bam, use GOTHiC R package to get significant interactions.
